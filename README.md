# STEDI Human Balance Analytics Project

## Overview

The STEDI Human Balance Analytics Project utilizes machine learning and data engineering techniques to analyze accelerometer data and predict the risk of falls based on human movement patterns. This project is organized to help analyze, visualize, and process data from wearable sensors, with the goal of identifying balance-related issues that may indicate a higher risk of falls.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies individuals based on their balance behavior, using accelerometer data collected from wearable devices. The model is designed to detect individuals at a high risk of falling based on their movement patterns.

### Key Goals:
- Analyze accelerometer data to extract relevant features for balance prediction.
- Train machine learning models to classify subjects by their fall risk.
- Deploy and evaluate the model’s effectiveness.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics.git
   cd STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. To start analyzing the data, you can run the relevant scripts in the `scripts/` folder.

## Data Pipeline

One of the key components of this project is the data pipeline, which processes raw accelerometer data. For example, the script `accelerometer_landing_to_trusted.py` is designed to transform incoming raw data into a trusted and ready-to-use format for machine learning models.

To execute the pipeline:
```bash
python scripts/accelerometer_landing_to_trusted.py
```

## Running Models and Analysis

The project contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to train and evaluate the machine learning models. Some of the key steps involved are:

1. **Data preprocessing** - Transform raw accelerometer data into meaningful features.
2. **Model training** - Use algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
3. **Model evaluation** - Assess the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
